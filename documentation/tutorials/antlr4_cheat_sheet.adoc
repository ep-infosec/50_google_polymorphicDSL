## Logical Operators

_Logical and/or/not_

### And

There is no visible operator for AND. Concatenating is done implicitly.
Any phrases separated by whitespaces are joined together:

*'Hello, ' 'how ' 'are ' 'you?'*

-> Hello, how are you?

### OR

Logical or is used with the *|* operator.


*'I like ' ('cats' | 'dogs')*

-> I like dogs

-> I like cats

### NOT

Logical not is used with the *~* operator.

*'My parameter is "'  ~'"'+  '"'*

-> My parameter is "awesome!"

-> My parameter is "The number 4"
