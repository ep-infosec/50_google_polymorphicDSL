= PDSL Custom Grammars

Sometimes the best way to represent how your application behaves is through some
format that no one has natively supported yet. PDSL natively supports gherkin. See <<quickstart.adoc#, the gherkin quickstart>> if you think gherkin can meet your use case.

== A custom grammar

Suppose you made a website. Certain pages can only be accessed by priviledged user.
Assume it is your job to make sure that it is possible to
navigate from one page to all others a user has permission to visit.

Technically you can do something like this in gherkin:

[source,cucumber]
----
Feature: A Website

    Scenario: Users can navigate to all legal pages from any page they're on

        Given a user is on the sign in page
        Then the user can navigate to the home page after they sign in
----

But it can quickly become huge and difficult to reason with.

[source,cucumber]
----
    Given a user is on the sign in page
    Then the user can navigate to the home page after they sign in

    #Going the other way
    Given a user is on the home page
    Then they can sign out and navigate to the sign in page

    Given a user is on the sign in page
    When the user navigates to the home page after they sign in
    Then the user can navigate to their order history

    # Going the other way
    Given the user is on the order history page
    Then they can navigate to the home page

    Given the user is on the order history page
    Then they can navigate to the home page
    Then they can sign out and navigate to the sign in page

    # Dozens or hundreds of similar tests
----

Gherkin is great, but it was designed for user acceptance tests and intended to be
simple and easy to understand. While the requirements here are in natural language,
it is still difficult to visualize what is going on as it gets bigger.

A better way to visualize these kinds of requirements would be with a graph:

image:../images/graphviz/website_navigation.png["Sample website navigation path"]

At a glance this is far easier to understand. It is far more concise and the
permutation of navigation paths is implied by the image itself. It also indicates
that only admin users are able to access priviledged pages. Finally, we can tell that
the user is unable to navigate back to previous pages in special areas, such as after
they have provided payment.

== Creating a Custom Grammar

PDSL requires you to do the following:

. Define some test specification written in a domain specific language you make
. Generate an interpreter for it using ANTLR
. Convert the input into a generic _Test Specification_ from 1 or more files.
. Explain how many _Test Cases_ should be created from each specification
. Tell it where to find the test files you made (likely as files on a hard drive)

Some of that probably doesn't make sense to you right now, but it will as we go.

=== Use or create a DSL

For our example we're going to use a graph as a test case. The graph above was made using DOT. We're going to use a very simple subset of DOT as our DSL.

=== Create a Test with the DSL

The image above was made using the following DOT code:

include::../images/graphviz/website.dot[Source file]

There really isn't much we need here. We define the links between web pages using
`->` tokens, and we indicate a page is admin only using `[color="red"]`.

The above code will be our actual test case.

=== Create an Interpreter

Our DSL is understandable, but we need to be able to map some Java code to execute
when it sees certain phrases in our DSL.

This is where ANTLR comes in. ANTLR is a parser generator we can use to rapidly
create something that reads our DOT file and then fire off a Java method when we
need it to. It will do a lot of work for us, all we need to do is tell it how to
read the DOT file we made.

First we create a lexer (which is essentially a dictionary that specifies what all
the words in our language can be).

----
include::../../examples/tutorial/src/test/antlr4/com/example/DotNavigationLexer.g4[]
----

After that we make a parser (which specifies how we're allowed to combine the words).

----
include::../../examples/tutorial/src/test/antlr4/com/example/DotNavigationParser.g4[]
----

The most important rule in our parser is _dotFile_, which says we have a _HEADER_ token, followed by 1 or more _linkedPages_, followed by the _END_GRAPH_.

This is going to be our _start rule_ and _syntax check_ rule that the PDSL framework
will use. It is the entry point we use to recognize the file and phrases we'll see.

==== Create a Listener

This is the part where we'll fire off Java code when we hit the sentences we care
about. ANTLR will generate code we can use for our listener.

Because we named our parser _DotNavigationParser_ there will be a base class named
_DotNavigationParserBaseListener_ with an empty, no-op implementation for each parser
rule we made. We can just override the method(s) we care about. In our case we only
care about one, the _linkedPages_ rule which specifies all the possible navigation
paths.

=== Interpret the Specifications

PDSL was designed to run tests on arbitrary grammars like the one we just made.
However, some grammars might have things like loops or something (like the _Examples_
tables in gherkin). We need to tell PDSL how to organize information in our test as
we read it.

In our case we just have a single DOT file that can be read top to bottom. It has no
nested tests within it or any fancy features. Because of that we can just use a
built in feature of PDSL: the _FileDelimitedTestSpecificationFactory_.

What this does is produce one specification for each file PDSL reads (as opposed to
many). To learn about specification factories in general or the other factories PDSL
provides out of the box, see <<../specification_factories.adoc#, Specification Factories>>.

=== Determine how to produce Test Cases from the Specification

Our needs are simple: we read one DOT file and want to create one test case from it.

PDSL has a standard factory for this called _SingleTestOutputPreorderTestCaseFactory_
. It is capable of doing some fancy things (such as running some sentences before
a group of other sentences). We don't actually need any of that, but it will work
just fine for our purposes.

To lear more about Test Case Factories in general see <<../test_case_factories.adoc#, Test Case Factories>>.

=== How to find the Test Resources

PDSL needs to know where and how to look for our DOT file. Unless you tell it
otherwise, PDSL will look in the file system for the test data. Since we have a DOT
file on a hard drive this is perfect.

All we need to do is be able to tell PDSL _where_ the files are.

=== Create the Test Runner

Since we now know everything we need, we can make the PDSL test runner:
[source,Java]
----
include::../../examples/tutorial/src/test/java/com/pdsl/custom/CustomGrammarTest.java[]
----

At this point we're done! We've made a custom grammar out of thin air and gave PDSL
enough information it was able to extract the information we care about. While this
is just a simple demo, converting this to a practical, real world framework doesn't
require much additional effort.
